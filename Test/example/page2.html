The Dark Knight Rises is an upcoming superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan and the story with David S. Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film will be the third installment in Nolan's Batman film series, and is a sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008). The Dark Knight Rises is intended to be the conclusion of the series. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman will all reprise their roles from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The film will take place eight years after the events of The Dark Knight and will introduce the characters of Selina Kyle and Bane—portrayed by Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy, respectively—two villains from the Batman mythology.[1]

Nolan was initially hesitant about returning to the series for a second time, but agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. The film has inspirations in the Batman comic book series Knightfall (1993), which debuted the villain Bane; The Dark Knight Returns (1986), in which Batman returns to Gotham City after a ten-year absence; and No Man's Land (1999), which depicts Gotham being overrun by gangs.

Filming took place in various locations, including locations in India, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York, New Jersey, and Pittsburgh. Nolan utilized IMAX cameras for much of the filming to optimize the quality of the picture. As with The Dark Knight, viral marketing campaigns began early during production to help promote the upcoming film. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign; developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film and theatrical trailers, and sending random pieces of information regarding the film's plot to various companies. The Dark Knight Rises is scheduled for release in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada on July 20, 2012.[2][3]
